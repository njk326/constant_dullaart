            <p>This piece of work is part of a series of browser-based artworks by Constant Dullaart. It incorporates an animated 
                interface of the Google search page with the intention to draw attention to the infrastructure of mega corporations 
                that have been involved in the many users’ experiences of the internet. Taking the interface as a medium, its functionality 
                is retained but with the continuous rotation, the experience of using the search page becomes increasingly absurd - not 
                only was browsing difficult, it becomes hypnotic and nauseating. Dullaart's attempts to prompt users to consider 
                their reliance on such platforms.

                 to do–to have like this 360-degree turn of the camera. I felt like that would be this ultimate thing. I could make this 
                 vision of this new world turn again."</i></p>

            <p>“High Retention, Slow Delivery” was launched with the aim to examine the mechanisms of control and the hierarchies of social media. It is an online 
                performance by Dullaart where he purchased 2.5 million fake instagram followers, then distributing them amongst a selected group of people in the 
                art-world, granting them the coveted 100,000 milestone on social media and at the same time “equalizing” these accounts.
