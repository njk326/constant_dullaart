            <p>Constant Dullaart is a conceptual artist whose works explores the intersections between art and technology in a digital age 
            and how the internet has come to inform and manipulate our relationships with art and image. Dullaart challenges the boundaries 
            of manipulating power structures and mega corporations like Google, Facebook, and Instagram. He uses the internet as a medium for 
            his work and is constantly reframing what the natural and the normal is on the Internet.</p>
