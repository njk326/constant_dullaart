                    With attention culture so dominant, is it possible to ignore the numerical values next to a person’s name? <br>
                    Consider the art world, would the artist benefit in being ‘liked’ as a profile user or in their artistic productions? With fake followers, what are the consequences in relation to artists’ works?

                        As the market dominance of Google grows, there are increasing surfaces of criticisms about its services and actions. 
                        The lack in search neutrality and the generation of filter bubbles can result in partial or complete misinformation of its users. It becomes unavoidable. 
                        Such mega corporations can alter the way we view information. <br>
                        Should we be more welcoming of full transparency of information? What are the consequences of this possibility? How reliant should we be to such platforms?</p>
